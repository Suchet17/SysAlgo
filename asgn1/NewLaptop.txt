Since I have in interest in Programming and Computational Biology, I would look for a laptop with at least 16GB RAM and a CPU with a high processor frequency for fast execution of code. An integrated graphics card could serve my purposes, but a dedicated GPU would be preferable due to its parallelization capabilities. I would also look for laptops with 1TB SSD storage. An ethernet port would be useful.
